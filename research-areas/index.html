    Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have a diverse range of social, economic, and military uses. However, since UAVs communicate through wireless technology, they are susceptible to security attacks. Establishing trust among UAVs is one of the most critical security elements for mitigating these risks in UAV networks. However, due to UAVs’ limited resources, implementing conventional trust-building methods in UAV networks becomes difficult. Additionally, as the number of UAVs grows, this problem becomes more serious. To overcome this problem, we propose a lightweight authentication cum attestation system for UAV swarms. The protocol is based on using a formal Mao Boyd logic method, we show that the proposed protocol is feasible, scalable, and secure. Comparative studies demonstrate that the suggested protocol outperforms the current state-of-the-art.

    Tor or "The Onion Router" is one of the most popular, secure, and widely used anonymous routing systems.
It is the backbone behind the emergence of the dark web. As a
second-generation onion routing system, Tor’s users are protected
from any censorship and assures complete anonymity. Tor is
based on a worldwide network of relays operated by volunteers
around the globe. Tor remains one of the most popular and
secure tools against network surveillance, traffic analysis, and
information censorship due to its strong employment of encryption, authentication, and routing protocols. With the growing computational capabilities of adversaries, the question remains
how long Tor would be able to sustain adversarial attacks and
guarantee anonymity. In this paper, we present the foundation
of the Tor network, it’s working, the possible attacks against
Tor, and the network’s defense strategies. Also, we present a
case study on a proposed deep learning framework that employs
bandwidth performance to identify the server’s location in the
Tor network. This paper underlines the current status and future
ahead with the use of Tor’s network.

    Recent times have shown a rapid development in wireless communication-based technologies, especially in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based applications. However, UAV-based applications have not achieved its full potential due to security vulnerabilities that it suffers. The communication between the drones and the base station is susceptible to intrusion. Many authentication protocols like Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF) based protocols have been proposed to mitigate this issue that ensures reliable, secure, and fast drone authentication. However, the major drawback in these papers is that they require noise-resistant and theoretically ideal PUF. This assumption limits the use-case of UAV based authentication mechanism. Thus, we propose a novel authentication technique using Shamir’s secret sharing, which is resistant to noisy PUFs. The correctness and perfectness achieved by the proposed protocol are shown using Shannon’s information communication theory. Moreover, Subsequent analysis shows that our proposed scheme improves the performance of authentication of UAVs.

    Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have enabled a
broad spectrum of applications serving social, commercial, and
military purposes. But, since UAVs use wireless communication
technologies, they are highly vulnerable to security threats.
Establishing trust with the base station is the most fundamental
security aspect in UAV networks to mitigate these threats.
However, due to UAV’s constrained resources, traditional trust
establishment schemes in UAV networks become increasingly
challenging. This issue escalates as the number of UAVs increases.
To address this issue, we propose an authentication cum attestation protocol for UAV Swarms using an optimal communication
trajectory, which can establish the required trust in a lightweight
manner. Furthermore, our protocol uses Physical Unclonable
Functions (PUFs) and thus guarantees physical security as well.
We demonstrate that the proposed protocol is feasible, scalable,
and secure using a formal Mao Boyd logic approach. Comparative analyses show that the proposed protocol outperforms the
state-of-the-art.

  One of the significant challenges of secure communication in resource-constrained environments is the overhead of integrity protection. The tags of traditional Message Authentication Code (MAC) schemes (e.g., HMAC) occupy most of the total payload. This led to the rise of innovative MAC solutions such as CuMACs, Mini-MACs, and ProMACs. These techniques employ state chaining and tag truncation for improved performance and enhanced security levels. These techniques have been relatively unpopular, and these face some security or performance issues to be deployed in real-world scenarios. In this work, we describe how these different schemes have evolved and the limitations of these approaches. Finally, we propose a new MAC approach that reduces communication overhead without compromising security.

    Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) swarm-based applications require a large collection of UAVs deployed in a region to work cohesively. It is imperative to secure UAV-BS (base station) communications to operate such a large number of unattended UAVs in hostile environments. Thus, there is a need to address the security vulnerabilities in the communication exchanges. Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) based UAV authentication has recently emerged as a potential solution to overcome adversarial attacks like man-in-middle attacks, physical cloning, and replay attacks, etc. PUF based authentication provides lightweight validation, reduces the communication and computational overhead for the device. The performance of PUF based authentication protocols is heavily influenced by the choice of proper network topology. In this article, we provide comparative performance analysis for three PUF based protocols that employ different network topologies. The performance analysis is done based on parameters like the time for topology generation, the number of bottleneck connections, and the traffic load in the network.

    Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) domain has seen rapid developments in recent years. UAVs have been deployed for many applications and missions like data transmission, cellular service provisioning, and computational offloading tasks etc. Yet, UAV deployment is still limited, partially owing to the security challenges it poses. UAVs are particularly vulnerable to physical capture, cloning attacks, eavesdropping, and man in middle attacks. To address some of these security problems, this paper develops an authentication protocol for use in UAV swarms. To ensure physical security and rapid authentication, the proposed protocol uses Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). The protocol achieves high scalability compared to the state of the art by authenticating multiple devices at once. The proposed protocol supports dynamic topologies and multi-hop communication by using spanning tree-based traversal. It is also resistant to mobility, device failure, etc., and its improvements are achieved at significantly lower communication and communication cost as compared to state-of-the-art protocols.

    This letter proposes a scalable authentication protocol to address the security vulnerabilities in UAV-base station communication.  UAVs are particularly vulnerable to multiple cyberattacks such as physical capture, cloning attacks, eavesdropping, and man-in-middle attacks. Current solutions propose to address these issues using one-to-one authentication. However, the approach is not scalable especially in scenarios where a group of UAVs is deployed to provide services to end-users. The scalability is achieved using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The proposed protocol outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of total authentication time.

    <p>In recent times, there is a paradigm shift to cloud services that offer on-demand computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power. The main reason for the shift is that it removes the user’s active participation to perform computationally intensive tasks. However, current cloud-based services incur high user latency as being deployed very far from the user. One alternative solution to the traditional cloud-based paradigm is drone-based edge computing. In drone edge computing, drones are located near the user and deployed to provide data offload services. There have been many works that have addressed the issue of efficient task assignment in edge devices. This paper presents a concrete analytical performance model for drone cloudlet networks and factors that influence the service response time to the user. The results can be helpful for network administrators to make the current edge computing paradigm faster, more robust and, cost-effective.

    Drones, commonly known as Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming very popular nowadays due to their
    wide applicability in areas ranging from package delivery systems
    to automated military applications. Nevertheless, communication
    security between a UAV and its base station (BS) is critical for
    completing its task without leaking sensitive information either to
    the adversaries or to unauthenticated users. UAVs are especially
    vulnerable to physical and node tampering attacks. Further, since
    UAV devices are generally equipped with small batteries and
    limited memory storage, lightweight security techniques are best
    suited for them. Addressing these issues, a lightweight mutual
    authentication scheme based on Physical Unclonable Function
    (PUF) for UAV-BS authentication is presented in this paper.
    We present a formal security analysis as well as old-fashioned
    cryptanalysis to show that our protocol provides various security
    features such as mutual authentication, user anonymity, etc. and
    is resilient against many security attacks such as masquerade,
    replay, node tampering attacks, etc. We also show a performance
    comparison of our protocol with the state-of-the-art UAV-BS
    authentication protocols, based on computation, communication
    and memory storage cost.

    <p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, popularly known as UAVs, have been used in many applications, from healthcare services to military assignments with diverse capabilities such as data transmission, cellular service provisioning, and computational offloading tasks. UAV’s have been recently used to provide Security as a Service (SaaS). SaaS involves techni- cal solutions like anti-virus and anti-spam software, firewalls, using secure operating systems, etc. UAV’s are resource constrained devices, and thus they are connected to the base station (BS) so that they may avail the computational facilities of the BS. The UAV’s connect themselves to the base station using cluster heads (intermediary devices). At times several UAVs cooperatively come together to serve a given region and such a group of UAVs is called a swarm of UAVs. In real-world scenarios, many stakeholders come together to form UAV swarm configuration proving services to users. Each stakeholder wants to maximize his gains. In this work, we propose a pricing Stackelberg game among UAVs, Cluster heads, and BS by formulating their behavioral utilities. Using particle swarm optimization on each entity’s utility functions, we create an optimal price strategy for each entity to maximize their profit.</p>

    <p>The batteries of electric vehicles enable the functionality of V2G networks. The purpose of V2G is to handle the trading of energy for electric vehicles powered by batteries as well as the power grid. This is essential to make more efficient use of the energy of the grid. The electrical energy stored in the EV batteries can function as a power source for the grid and other energy-deficient EVs. The energy stored in the batteries of the EVs could be used to pump power into the grid when the load on the grid is too heavy.
Despite its wide-ranging applications, the privacy and safety of intelligent grids continue to be a severe problem. Any protocol designed for V2G applications must be safe, lightweight, and safeguard the car owner’s privacy. As individuals usually do not guard EVs and charging stations, physical security is also a must.  To address these issues, we are proposing a Real-time Automotive Mutual Authentication protocol for V2G devices based on Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF). PUFs are used by the proposed protocol to obtain a two-step mutual authentication (MA) between an EV and the Grid Server. It is lightweight, safe, and preserves privacy.</p>

    <p>Over the past few years, with increasing mobile
traffic and decreasing revenue per user, Heterogeneous Networks
(HetNets) have become a topic of interest to many stakeholders.
HetNets is a combination of networks with different access
technologies and cell types working with each other. Mobile
network operators are keen to reduce operational expenses
by deploying HetNets while they provide better QoS to the
user anywhere, anytime wireless connectivity. Although HetNets
provide various benefits, yet many open issues need to be
addressed to harness their impact. They are also prone to several
security threats such as physical attacks, man-in-the-middle
(MITM) attacks, impersonation attacks, replay attacks, and node
tampering attacks. Moreover, due to the different nature and
structure of each network in a HetNet, secure handover between
various wireless networks is a complex task that is not yet
resolved. In this paper, we address the issues mentioned above
by designing a secure handover mechanism that is resistant to
both passive and active attacks. We also show a performance

    <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) have been slowly replacing conventional fuel based vehicles since the last decade. EVs are not only environment-friendly but when used in conjunction with a smart grid, also open up new possibilities and a Vehicle- Smart Grid ecosystem, commonly called V2G can be achieved. This would not only encourage people to switch to environment- friendly EVs or Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), but also positively aid in load management on the power grid, and present new economic benefits to all the entities involved in such an ecosystem. Nonetheless, privacy and security remains a serious concern of smart grids. The devices used in V2G are tiny, inexpensive, and resource constrained, which renders them susceptible to multiple attacks. Any protocol designed for V2G systems must be secure, lightweight, and must protect the privacy of the vehicle owner. Since EVs and charging stations are generally not guarded by people, physical security is also a must. To tackle these issues, we propose Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF) based Secure User Key-Exchange Authentication (SUKA) protocol for V2G systems. The proposed protocol uses PUFs to achieve a two-step mutual authentication between an EV and the Grid Server. It is lightweight, secure, and privacy preserving. Simulations show that the proposed protocol performs better and provides more security features than state-of-the-art V2G authentication protocols. The security of the proposed protocol is shown using a formal security model and analysis.</p>

    The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed several limitations of existing healthcare systems. Thus, there is a surge in healthcare innovation and new business models using computer-mediated virtual environments to provide an alternative healthcare system. Today, digital transformation is not limited to virtual communication alone but encompasses digitalizing the network of social connections in the healthcare industry using metaverse technology. The metaverse is a universal and immersive virtual world facilitated by virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). This paper presents the first effort to offer a comprehensive survey that examines the latest metaverse developments in the healthcare industry, which covers seven domains: telemedicine, clinical care, education, mental health, physical fitness, veterinary, and pharmaceuticals. We review metaverse applications and deeply discuss technical issues and available solutions in each domain that can help develop a self-sustaining, persistent, and future-proof solution for medical healthcare systems. Finally, we highlight the challenges that must be tackled before fully embracing the metaverse for the healthcare industry.

    A distributed stock exchange system encompasses multiple network hosts that participate
in the sharing and exchange of resources. In such exchanges, the mediator or stock exchange
must manage and delineate all operations in a cohesive manner. Stock exchange (SE)
also acts as the transaction manager to provide consistent, isolated, durable, and atomic
transactions for participating entities. However, the work for the stock exchange is not so
straightforward as it may sound. With multiple transactions happening per second, the
global serializability and concurrency control becomes an issue resulting in multiple threats
and vulnerabilities. We propose a novel stock exchange that integrates time series prediction
to distributed transactions and understanding the rapid global transactions and limitations
of resources at the stock exchange. We use distributed acyclic graph (DAG) based distributed
ledger technology IOTA to provide security and consensus for independent users. The paper
proposes a time-variant model that adjusts its predictions based on transactions, moments
of observations, participating entities, and history. We show that our model outcasts other
state-of-art schemes in terms of prediction accuracy. Also, the model is fair, fast, and scalable
to handle millions of transactions per second.

    <p>Credit scoring is a rigorous statistical analysis carried out by lenders and other third parties to access an individual’s creditworthiness. Lenders use credit scoring, to estimate the degree of risk in lending money to an individual. However, credit score evaluation is primarily based on a transaction record, payment history, professional background, etc. sourced from different credit bureaus. So, evaluating a credit score is a laborious and tedious task involving a lot of paperwork. In this paper, we propose how blockchain can provide the solution to decentralized credit scoring evaluation and reducing the amount of dependence of paperwork. Lending money is not always objective but subjective to every lender. The decision of lending involves different levels of risk and uncertainty depending on their perspective. This paper uses prospect theory to model the optimal investment strategy for different risk vs return scenarios.</p>

  Supply chain is a complex system of organizations, people, information, and resources involved in providing services from supplier to customer. The changing technology has made the survival in commerce highly competitive and price sensitive. Blockchain technology can be the game-changer for decentralizing infrastructure and building a trust layer for business logic. BitCom is a commerce model based on the emerging technology of blockchain. It is a framework deriving its roots from both permissioned and permissionless blockchains to achieve a feasible solution to the problem of automating commerce. The model caters to need of profit maximization for suppliers and consumers using iterative auction mechanism. Parties bid to smart contract which act as auctioneer for maximizing the profit. It uses flexible smart contracts for negotiations and transactions while permissionless entry is provided to the users. Mathematical parameter named credibility score has been created to deal with trust issues in the decentralized network. BitCom provides a fresh perspective on the concept of supply chain and commerce.  The objective of model remains to provide enhanced transparency, greater scalability, better security and scope of innovation. It is likely to propel the next industrial revolution, providing a new paradigm for doing business in finance, transportation, shared economy.

  Smart grid (SG) provides a peer-to-peer energy trading mechanism wherein the electric vehicles (EVs) can trade for energy with their peers using the information and communication technologies. However, the dependence on third party for coordinating the energy trading decisions leads to a bottleneck for any distributed environment. Therefore, blockchain technology can provide a privacy-preserving and effective consensus mechanism without the control of trusted third party. Although blockchain provides inherent secure framework for transactional process, but the this security is because of computational complexity enforced. In SG environment, the conventional blockchain process could not be employed due to limited computational resources with EVs, which makes it difficult to solve the tough computational puzzles to validate the transactions. On the other hand, any compromise on the computation difficulty makes it more vulnerable to various types of attacks. Therefore, in this paper, SmartChain: a blockchain inspired smart and scalable ledger framework which does not require much computational complexity is designed for secure peer-to-peer energy trading in SG ecosystem. The proposed framework is evaluated using the parameters such as execution and validation time. The results obtained depict the superiority of SmartChain in contrast to the conventional blockchain process.

    <p>Credit scoring is a rigorous statistical analysis carried out by lenders and other third parties to access an individual’s creditworthiness. Lenders use credit scoring, to estimate the degree of risk in lending money to an individual. However, credit score evaluation is primarily based on a transaction record, payment history, professional background, etc. sourced from different credit bureaus. So, evaluating a credit score is a laborious and tedious task involving a lot of paperwork. In this paper, we propose how blockchain can provide the solution to decentralized credit scoring evaluation and reducing the amount of dependence of paperwork. Lending money is not always objective but subjective to every lender. The decision of lending involves different levels of risk and uncertainty depending on their perspective. This paper uses prospect theory to model the optimal investment strategy for different risk vs return scenarios.</p>

  Supply chain is a complex system of organizations, people, information, and resources involved in providing services from supplier to customer. The changing technology has made the survival in commerce highly competitive and price sensitive. Blockchain technology can be the game-changer for decentralizing infrastructure and building a trust layer for business logic. BitCom is a commerce model based on the emerging technology of blockchain. It is a framework deriving its roots from both permissioned and permissionless blockchains to achieve a feasible solution to the problem of automating commerce. The model caters to need of profit maximization for suppliers and consumers using iterative auction mechanism. Parties bid to smart contract which act as auctioneer for maximizing the profit. It uses flexible smart contracts for negotiations and transactions while permissionless entry is provided to the users. Mathematical parameter named credibility score has been created to deal with trust issues in the decentralized network. BitCom provides a fresh perspective on the concept of supply chain and commerce.  The objective of model remains to provide enhanced transparency, greater scalability, better security and scope of innovation. It is likely to propel the next industrial revolution, providing a new paradigm for doing business in finance, transportation, shared economy.
